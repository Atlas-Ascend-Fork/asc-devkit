The TConv3DBackpropInputTiling struct contains the specification information of the Conv3DBackpropInput operator and the related parameters of the Tiling algorithm. It is passed to the Conv3DBackpropInput kernel side for data splitting, data transfer, and computation. The following table describes the parameters of the TConv3DBackpropInputTiling struct.

You can obtain the TConv3DBackpropInputTiling struct by calling the [GetTiling](GetTiling.md) API. For details, see [Conv3DBackpropInput Tiling Usage Guidelines](Conv3DBackpropInput_Tiling_usage.md). Currently, custom configuration of the parameters in the TConv3DBackpropInputTiling struct is not supported.
