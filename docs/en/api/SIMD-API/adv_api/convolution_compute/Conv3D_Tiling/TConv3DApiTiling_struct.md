The TConv3DApiTiling structure contains the Conv3D operator specification information and the related parameters of the Tiling split algorithm. It is passed to the Conv3D kernel side for data splitting, data movement, and computation. For the parameter description of the TConv3DApiTiling structure, see [Table 1](#table18244199192620).

You can obtain the TConv3DApiTiling structure by calling the [GetTiling](GetTiling.md) API. For details, see [Conv3D Tiling Usage Guidelines](Conv3D_Tiling_usage.md). Currently, custom configuration of the parameters in the TConv3DApiTiling structure is not supported.

Note: The M axis above is the vertical axis of the input after img2col expansion during the forward convolution operation, numerically equal to Hout \* Wout. K is the horizontal axis of the input after img2col expansion, numerically equal to KD\*C1\*KH\*KW\*C0. KD/KH/KW are the Depth, Height, and Width of Weight, which are abbreviations of kernelD/kernelH/kernelW. N is the Cout of Weight. See Figure 1 for details.
