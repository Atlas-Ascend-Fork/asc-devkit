## Description

The header file path is `"c_api/sync/sync.h"`.

This API is paired with [asc_sync_intra_arrive](asc_sync_intra_arrive.md) to implement synchronization between AIC and a single AIV in a single AI Core (mode 4 of the [four inter-core synchronization modes](../system_sync_overview.md#fig_sync_control_mode)). The principle of inter-core synchronization is as follows:

- Scenario where a single AIV waits for the AIC:
  - After the AIC within one AI Core executes `asc_sync_intra_arrive`, it sends a notification to the scheduling module, which then increments the counter corresponding to the `sync_id` of the single AIV within that AI Core by 1.
  - The paired `asc_sync_intra_wait` on the single AIV detects that the counter for the corresponding `sync_id` is not 0, unblocks, and decrements the counter by 1.
- Scenario where the AIC waits for a single AIV:
  - After a single AIV within one AI Core executes `asc_sync_intra_arrive`, it sends a notification to the scheduling module, which then increments the counter corresponding to the AIC's `sync_id` by 1.
  - The paired `asc_sync_intra_wait` on the AIC detects that the counter for the corresponding `sync_id` is not 0, unblocks, and decrements the counter by 1.

For the specific execution principle of this synchronization mode, see the code snippet and accompanying timing diagram in [Synchronization Between AIC and a Single AIV in a Single AI Core (Mode 4)](key_features.md#single_ai_core_aic_single_aiv_sync).

## Prototype

```c
__aicore__ inline void asc_sync_intra_wait(pipe_t pipe,
                                           uint64_t sync_id)
```

## Parameters

**Table 1** Parameters

| Parameter | Input/Output | Description |
| :---  | :--- | :--- |
| pipe | Input | Identifies the pipeline whose subsequent instructions are blocked until the counter corresponding to `sync_id` is non-zero.<br>The parameter type is the `pipe_t` enumeration. For the meaning of each enumeration value, see [Hardware pipeline type](../intra_core_sync/intra_core_sync_overview.md#hardware-pipeline-type).<br>For the supported `pipe` values of AIC and AIV, see [Constraints](#supported_pipe_combinations). |
| sync_id | Input | Marker for inter-core synchronization, used to identify the same group of synchronization signals. Each `sync_id` has its own independent 4-bit counter. One AI Core consists of 1 AIC and 2 AIVs. The AIC side has 32 `sync_id` values (0 to 31), and each AIV side has 16 `sync_id` values (0 to 15).<br>For the correspondence between the `sync_id` values of `asc_sync_intra_arrive` and `asc_sync_intra_wait` during synchronization, see [Constraints](#constraints). |

## Return Value

None

## Pipeline Type

PIPE_S

## Constraints

- The kernel function that calls this API must not use the `__cube__` or `__vector__` [function execution space qualifier](../../../../../guide/programming_guide/language_extension/simd_builtin_keywords.md#function-execution-space-qualifiers). When either qualifier is used, the hardware does not enable the scheduling module, so inter-core synchronization cannot work properly. For the pair of APIs `asc_sync_intra_arrive` and `asc_sync_intra_wait`, the supported function execution space qualifiers are `__mix__(1, 2)`.
- For the `asc_sync_intra_arrive` API, the passed `pipe` parameter **takes effect**. The supported `pipe` values of AIC and AIV are shown in [Table 2](#aic_aiv_supported_pipe).<a id="supported_pipe_combinations"></a>

  **Table 2**  Supported `pipe` values of AIC and AIV<a id="aic_aiv_supported_pipe"></a>

  | Core Type | Supported pipe Values |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | AIC | `PIPE_S`, `PIPE_M`, `PIPE_MTE1`, `PIPE_MTE2`, `PIPE_FIX` |
  | AIV | `PIPE_S`, `PIPE_MTE2`, `PIPE_MTE3`, `PIPE_V` |

- Unlike other inter-core synchronization modes, when this API is paired with `asc_sync_intra_arrive`, it **does not require** the `sync_id` passed to `arrive` and `wait` to be the same. Instead, the two must conform to the following cross-core ID mapping relationship; otherwise, undefined behavior occurs.<a id="sync_id_mapping"></a>
    - The `sync_id` values 0 to 15 of the `asc_sync_intra_arrive` API called in AIV0 correspond to the `sync_id` values 0 to 15 of the `asc_sync_intra_wait` API called in AIC, respectively.
    - The `sync_id` values 0 to 15 of the `asc_sync_intra_arrive` API called in AIV1 correspond to the `sync_id` values 16 to 31 of the `asc_sync_intra_wait` API called in AIC, respectively.
    - The `sync_id` values 0 to 15 of the `asc_sync_intra_arrive` API called in AIC correspond to the `sync_id` values 0 to 15 of the `asc_sync_intra_wait` API called in AIV0, respectively.
    - The `sync_id` values 16 to 31 of the `asc_sync_intra_arrive` API called in AIC correspond to the `sync_id` values 0 to 15 of the `asc_sync_intra_wait` API called in AIV1, respectively.
- Each counter can be incremented up to 15 consecutive times (at which point the counter value is 15). The counter value must not exceed 15; otherwise, an exception is triggered.
- This API blocks subsequent instructions in the `pipe` pipeline. When the counter corresponding to `sync_id` is non-zero, the block is released and the counter is decremented by 1.
- The value range of `sync_id` on AIC is [0, 31]. Values outside this range are truncated by bit width to the lower 5 bits (for example, when syncId=32, the truncated value is 0; when syncId=33, the truncated value is 1).
- The value range of `sync_id` on AIV is [0, 15]. Values outside this range are truncated by bit width to the lower 4 bits (for example, when syncId=16, the truncated value is 0; when syncId=17, the truncated value is 1).

## Examples

`asc_sync_intra_wait` must be paired with `asc_sync_intra_arrive`. For a specific calling example, see [asc_sync_intra_arrive Calling Example](asc_sync_intra_arrive.md#examples).
