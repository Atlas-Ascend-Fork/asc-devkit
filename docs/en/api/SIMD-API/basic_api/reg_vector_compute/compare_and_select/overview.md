Comparison and selection support the following APIs:

**Table 1**  Comparison and selection APIs

| API | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Compare](Compare.md) | Compares two **RegTensor** operands element by element, and writes the comparison result to the corresponding bit of the destination **MaskReg** operand according to the comparison mode specified by the template parameter. If the comparison result is true, the corresponding bit of the output result is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. |
| [Compares](Compares.md) | This API compares each element of the source operand with a scalar element by element, and determines whether the result is true according to the comparison mode specified by the template parameter. If true, the corresponding bit of the output **MaskReg** is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.<br>The comparison modes include LT (less than), GT (greater than), GE (greater than or equal to), EQ (equal to), NE (not equal to), and LE (less than or equal to). |
| [Select](Select.md) | Given two source operands **srcReg0** and **srcReg1**, selects elements according to the bit values of the mask to obtain the destination operand **dstReg**. When a mask bit is 1, the element at the corresponding position is selected from **srcReg0**; when the bit is 0, the element at the corresponding position is selected from **srcReg1**. |
| [Squeeze](Squeeze.md) | Copies the valid elements selected by the mask from the input **srcReg** to **dstReg** in sequence. The valid elements are arranged contiguously from low to high in **dstReg**. The remaining positions in **dstReg** are set to 0. |
