**TPipe** is used to centrally manage resources such as Device-side memory. A kernel function (**Kernel**) must and can only initialize one **TPipe** object. Its main functions include:

-   **Memory resource management**: Through the **InitBuffer** API of **TPipe**, memory can be allocated for **TQue** and **TBuf**, which are used for queue memory initialization and temporary variable memory initialization, respectively.
-   **Synchronization event management**: Through the **AllocEventID**, **ReleaseEventID**, and other APIs of **TPipe**, event IDs can be applied for and released for synchronization control.
