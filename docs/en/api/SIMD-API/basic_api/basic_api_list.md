The depth of the message queue is fixed at 4, and message space is allocated from top to bottom and then cyclically. When the message space pointed to by the message queue pointer is in the **FREE** state, **AllocMessage** returns the address of the space; otherwise, it waits in a loop until the current space is in the **FREE** state. |
| [PostMessage](cube_group_mgmt_ISASI/CubeResGroupHandle/PostMessage.md) | After obtaining the message space address **msg** through the **AllocMessage** API, constructs the message structure **CubeMsgType** and sends the message. |
| [PostFakeMsg](cube_group_mgmt_ISASI/CubeResGroupHandle/PostFakeMsg.md) | After obtaining the message space address through the **AllocMessage** API, the AIV sends a fake message and refreshes the message state **msgState** to **FAKE**. |
| [SetQuit](cube_group_mgmt_ISASI/CubeResGroupHandle/SetQuit.md) | After obtaining the message space address through the **AllocMessage** API, sends a quit message to inform the AIC corresponding to the message queue that it does not need to process messages in this queue. After the AIV corresponding to **Queue5** sends the quit message, **Block1** will no longer process any messages in **Queue5**. |
| [Wait](cube_group_mgmt_ISASI/CubeResGroupHandle/Wait.md) | After calling **PostMessage** or **PostFakeMessage**, queries whether the message has been processed by the AIC. |
| [FreeMessage](cube_group_mgmt_ISASI/CubeResGroupHandle/FreeMessage.md) | In the custom callback function logic, after message processing is complete, calls this API to refresh the message state to **FREE**; or refreshes the message state to **FREE** when the message state reaches the specified state **waitState**. |
| [SetSkipMsg](cube_group_mgmt_ISASI/CubeResGroupHandle/SetSkipMsg.md) | The AIC skips the processing of a specified number of fake messages, and this API is called only in the callback function. In the following figure, **Block0** skips three fake messages by calling **SetSkipMsg**. |
| [Arrive](cube_group_mgmt_ISASI/GroupBarrier/Arrive.md) | Notifies other waiting AIVs that this AIV has completed the tasks it depends on. |
| [GetWorkspaceLen](cube_group_mgmt_ISASI/GroupBarrier/GetWorkspaceLen.md) | Returns the size of the Global Memory message space occupied by the current **GroupBarrier**. |
| [UpdateKfcWorkspace](cube_group_mgmt_ISASI/KfcWorkspace/UpdateKfcWorkspace.md) | Updates the memory address used for the **CubeResGroupHandle** message communication workspace. When using the **CubeResGroupHandle** API, users need to use this API to manage the space address independently. |
| [GetKfcWorkspace](cube_group_mgmt_ISASI/KfcWorkspace/GetKfcWorkspace.md) | Obtains the memory address used for the **CubeResGroupHandle** message communication workspace. When using the **CubeResGroupHandle** API, users need to use this API to manage the space address independently. |

## Kernel-Tiling

| API Name | Function Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GET_TILING_DATA](Kernel-Tiling/GET_TILING_DATA.md) | Used to obtain the Tiling information passed into the operator kernel entry function and fill it into the registered TilingData structure. This function is compiled by macro expansion. The corresponding operator host implementation needs to define the TilingData structure, and implement and register the Tiling function that computes the TilingData. If the user registers multiple TilingData structures through TilingData structure registration, this API returns the default registered structure. |
| [GET_TILING_DATA_WITH_STRUCT](Kernel-Tiling/GET_TILING_DATA_WITH_STRUCT.md) | Use this API to specify a structure name, obtain the specified tiling information, and fill it into the corresponding Tiling structure. This function is compiled by macro expansion. The difference from GET\_TILING\_DATA is that GET\_TILING\_DATA can only obtain the default registered structure, while this API can obtain the corresponding structure based on the specified structure name. It is commonly used when different structures are registered for different TilingKeys. |
| [GET_TILING_DATA_MEMBER](Kernel-Tiling/GET_TILING_DATA_MEMBER.md) | Used to obtain the member variables of the tiling structure. |
| [GET_TILING_DATA_PTR_WITH_STRUCT](Kernel-Tiling/GET_TILING_DATA_PTR_WITH_STRUCT.md) | When using this macro, developers can obtain the corresponding Tiling information by specifying a structure name and fill it into the corresponding Tiling structure. After the filling is complete, this macro returns a pointer to the Tiling structure and modifies the pointer with the \_\_tiling\_data\_ptr\_\_ modifier. This modification ensures code uniformity and compatibility in both dynamic and static Shape scenarios. |
| [COPY_TILING_WITH_STRUCT](Kernel-Tiling/COPY_TILING_WITH_STRUCT.md) | Copies the Tiling structure and returns a pointer to the copied Tiling structure. This macro is applicable to nested structure scenarios and can copy the sub-structure member variables of a structure. This macro copies the specified structure to the stack, which is suitable for scenarios with frequent access to Tiling data and can accelerate data access. |
| [COPY_TILING_WITH_ARRAY](Kernel-Tiling/COPY_TILING_WITH_ARRAY.md) | Copies the array content of a specified size to the target array and returns a pointer to the copied array. It is applicable to the scenario of copying an array member variable of a structure. This macro copies the specified array to the stack, which is suitable for scenarios with frequent access to Tiling data and can accelerate data access. |
| [TILING_KEY_IS](Kernel-Tiling/TILING_KEY_IS.md) | In the kernel function (Kernel), determines whether the tiling_key of the current execution equals a certain key set by the host side at runtime, thereby identifying a kernel branch where tiling_key == key. |
| [TILING_KEY_LIST](Kernel-Tiling/TILING_KEY_LIST.md) | The TILING_KEY_LIST function is used in the kernel function (Kernel) to determine whether the TilingKey of the current execution matches the specified TilingKey configured on the Host side, thereby identifying the branch logic that satisfies the condition TilingKey == key1 or TilingKey == key2. |
| [REGISTER_TILING_DEFAULT](Kernel-Tiling/REGISTER_TILING_DEFAULT.md) | Used to register, on the kernel side, the default TilingData structure customized by the user using standard C++ syntax. |
| [REGISTER_TILING_FOR_TILINGKEY](Kernel-Tiling/REGISTER_TILING_FOR_TILINGKEY.md) | Used to register, on the kernel side, the TilingData custom structure that matches the TilingKey. This API requires a logical expression, in which the string "TILING_KEY_VAR" represents the actual TilingKey and expresses the range satisfied by the TilingKey. |
| [REGISTER_NONE_TILING](Kernel-Tiling/REGISTER_NONE_TILING.md) | When using a TilingData structure customized with standard C++ syntax on the kernel function (Kernel) side, if the user is unsure which structures need to be registered, this API can be used to inform the framework side that unregistered standard C++ syntax should be used to define TilingData, together with GET\_TILING\_DATA\_WITH\_STRUCT and GET\_TILING\_DATA\_MEMBER. |
| [Set Kernel Function (Kernel) Type](Kernel-Tiling/set_Kernel_type.md) | Used for users to customize the kernel type, controlling the operator to start only kernels of that type during execution, avoiding starting kernels that do not need to work and reducing kernel startup overhead. |

| [GetCtrlSpr(ISASI)](special_register_access/GetCtrlSpr_ISASI.md) | Reads the value of specific bits of the CTRL register (control register). |
| [ResetCtrlSpr(ISASI)](special_register_access/ResetCtrlSpr_ISASI.md) | Resets specific bits of the CTRL register (control register). |
| [GetSaturationFlag(ISASI)](special_register_access/GetSaturationFlag_ISASI.md) | Obtains the enabled state of the specified saturation mode during computation or precision conversion. |

| [GetSaturationStrategy](special_register_access/GetSaturationStrategy.md) | Obtains the currently used saturation mode configuration strategy. |
| [SetSaturationStrategy](special_register_access/SetSaturationStrategy.md) | Sets the saturation mode configuration strategy, selecting whether to use the saturation configuration of the specific computation API itself or the saturation mode set by SetSaturationFlag. |
