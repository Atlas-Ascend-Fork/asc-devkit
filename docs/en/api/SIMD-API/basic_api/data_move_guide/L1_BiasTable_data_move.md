## DataCopy (Continuous Data Movement from L1 to BiasTable Buffer)<a name="ZH-CN_TOPIC_0000002574022837"></a>

DataCopy implements continuous data movement from the L1 Buffer to the BiasTable Buffer, with the format and content remaining unchanged during the movement.

Specifically supported data paths are (represented by [logical position TPosition](../../basic_api/aux_data_structures/TPosition.md)):

- L1 Buffer -> BiasTable Buffer
    - C1 -> C2

The moved data is used for matrix computation. For details about the API, see [DataCopy (L1ToBiasTable-Buffer Data Movement)](../cube_compute_ISASI/cube_compute_load/DataCopy_L1ToBiasTable.md).

**src** and **dst** are the source operand and destination operand, respectively; **count** is the number of elements to be moved continuously.

```cpp
template <typename T>
__aicore__ inline void DataCopy(const LocalTensor<T>& dst, const LocalTensor<T>& src, const uint32_t count)
```

## DataCopy (High-Dimensional Splitting Data Movement from L1 to BiasTable Buffer)<a name="ZH-CN_TOPIC_0000002543262936"></a>

**DataCopy** implements continuous and non-continuous data movement from the L1 Buffer to the BiasTable Buffer, with the format and content unchanged during data movement.

High-dimensional splitting refers to implementing non-continuous movement by configuring movement parameters such as the number of data blocks, the length of a single data block, and the address offset.

Specifically supported data paths are (represented by [logical position TPosition](../../basic_api/aux_data_structures/TPosition.md)):

- L1 Buffer -> BiasTable Buffer
    - C1 -> C2

The moved data is used for matrix computation. For details about the API, see [DataCopy (L1ToBiasTable-Buffer Data Movement)](../cube_compute_ISASI/cube_compute_load/DataCopy_L1ToBiasTable.md).

**src** and **dst** are the source operand and destination operand, respectively; **repeatParams** is the movement parameter.

- Continuous or non-continuous movement scenario (high-dimensional splitting)

    ```cpp
    template <typename T>
    __aicore__ inline void DataCopy(const LocalTensor<T>& dst, const LocalTensor<T>& src, const DataCopyParams& repeatParams)
    ```

- Continuous or non-continuous movement scenario, supporting inconsistent data types between the source operand and the destination operand

    ```cpp
    template <typename T, typename U>
    __aicore__ inline void DataCopy(const LocalTensor<T>& dst, const LocalTensor<U>& src, const DataCopyParams& repeatParams)
    ```
