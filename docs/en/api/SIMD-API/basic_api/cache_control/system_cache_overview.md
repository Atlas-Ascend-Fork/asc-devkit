## Cache Type<a name="zh-cn_topic_0000002583420201_section112105011415"></a>

The primary role of Cache is to provide a high-speed buffer between the transfer unit or Scalar unit and external memory, thereby reducing data access latency and improving bandwidth utilization. Typically, frequently accessed data is written to Cache, and the transfer unit or Scalar unit preferentially reads data from Cache during execution. On a Cache miss, data is loaded from external memory and updated into Cache.

[Table 1](#table1) shows the functions of different Cache types, where Data Cache (DCache) and Instruction Cache (ICache) are used for caching data and instructions, respectively. The Cache types supported vary by product, as follows:

## Cache Operations and Usage Scenarios<a name="zh-cn_topic_0000002583420201_section054554323117"></a>

Table 2 describes the four basic cache operations and their core functions.

**Table 2**  Cache operations and function descriptions

| Operation name | Function description |
|---------|---------|
| Prefetch | The hardware automatically loads the data expected to be accessed into the cache in advance based on the access pattern, improving the speed of subsequent accesses. |
| Preload | The software actively loads specified data into the cache through explicit instructions, preparing for upcoming read and write operations. |
| Invalid | &bull;Marks the **Cache Line** (the smallest unit of cache operation) in the specified address range as "invalid", removing it from the cache.<br>&bull;Ensures that the next access to these memory addresses reloads data from GM instead of using potentially stale cached data.<br>&bull;Note: The Invalid operation does not check whether a cache line is "dirty" (dirty indicates that the data has been modified but not yet written back to GM). If dirty data exists, it is discarded directly. |
| Clean | Writes the modified data (dirty data) in the cache back to GM to avoid data loss. The Clean operation does not mark the cache line as "invalid", and the cache line remains valid. |

## Cache Write Policy and Cache Consistency Issues<a name="zh-cn_topic_0000002583420201_section053731716357"></a>

When writing data to GM with Cache enabled, the following two Cache write policies are available: Write-Back and Write-Through.

When the Write-Back policy is used for writing data to GM, the working principle is as follows:

- The developer expects to write data to GM (that is, expects the data to be written directly to GM), but the actual hardware behavior is as follows:
    - When data is modified, it is updated only in the Cache.
    - The data in the Cache is marked as "dirty".
    - The data is written back to GM only when the Cache Line is replaced (or when a Clean operation is explicitly performed by software). When the Cache Line is replaced is determined by hardware.

- When replacing Cache Line data:
    - When the Cache space is insufficient and data needs to be replaced, check whether the data to be replaced is "dirty".
    - If the data is "dirty", write it back to GM first, and then evict the Cache Line from the Cache.

When writing data to GM, if the write-through strategy is adopted, its working principle is as follows:

- The developer expects to write data to GM (that is, expects the data to be written directly to GM), while the actual hardware behavior is:
    - When data is modified, the data is updated in both the cache and GM immediately.
    - The cache line does not need to be marked as "dirty".

- When replacing cache line data:

    Since every write synchronously updates GM, the data in the cache does not have a "dirty" state, and there is no need to additionally write back to GM during replacement.

Under the write-back strategy, modified data is updated only in the local cache and is not immediately synchronized to GM. When other cores read the same address in GM, they obtain stale data, resulting in cache data inconsistency among different cores.
Cache consistency is the core mechanism for ensuring data correctness in multi-core systems. In simple terms, when multiple cores each have their own independent cache, they may cache the same data simultaneously. If one core modifies the data in its cache, the cache copies in other cores become "stale". If they are not synchronized in time, data inconsistency among multiple cores will occur, which in turn leads to computation errors.

<!-- npu="950,A3,910b" id5 -->
The following describes whether each type of cache in different products needs to consider inter-core data inconsistency:
<!-- npu="950" id3 -->
- For [NPU architecture version 3510](../../../../guide/programming_guide/language_extension/simd_builtin_keywords.md), the five types of caches supported by this product are as follows regarding inter-core data consistency:
    - L2 Cache: A cache shared among multiple cores, so there is no need to consider the issue of inter-core data inconsistency.
    - **DCache**: A multi-core independent cache, so inter-core data consistency must be considered.
    - **ICache**: Read-only, so inter-core data inconsistency does not need to be considered.
    - **NDDMA Cache**: A multi-core independent cache, so inter-core data consistency must be considered.
    - **SIMT DCache**: In SIMT, when data is written, it is immediately written to **GM**, so there is no consistency issue. When data is read from **GM**, the cache is multi-core independent, so inter-core data consistency must be considered.
<!-- end id3 -->
<!-- npu="A3,910b" id4 -->
- For [NPU architecture version 2201](../../../../guide/programming_guide/language_extension/simd_builtin_keywords.md), the inter-core data consistency of the three supported cache types is as follows:
    - **L2 Cache**: A cache shared among multiple cores, so inter-core data inconsistency does not need to be considered.
    - **DCache**: A multi-core independent cache, so inter-core data consistency must be considered.
    - **ICache**: Read-only, so inter-core data inconsistency does not need to be considered.

## Cache Control API Summary<a name="zh-cn_topic_0000002583420201_section489931219616"></a>

Table 3 summarizes the APIs related to cache control and their function descriptions by cache type (L2 Cache, DCache, ICache, and NDDMA Cache).

**Table 3**  Cache control API summary

| Cache type | API name | Function description |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| L2 Cache | [SetL2CacheHint](../../basic_api/data_structures/GlobalTensor/SetL2CacheHint.md) | Data read from and written to GM is cached in L2 Cache by default (L2 Cache is enabled by default). SetL2CacheHint can set whether L2 Cache is enabled for a GlobalTensor. |
| DCache | [DataCachePreload](DataCachePreload.md) | The DataCachePreload API preloads data from the specific GM address where the source address resides into DCache. Each call can preload only one Cache Line of data. |
| DCache | [DataCacheCleanAndInvalid](DataCacheCleanAndInvalid.md) | When the Scalar unit accesses GM, use this API to flush the Cache to ensure Cache consistency. The usage scenarios are as follows:<br>&bull;When reading data from GM that may have been modified by other cores externally, use the DataCacheCleanAndInvalid API to directly access GM and obtain the latest data.<br>&bull;When the user writes data to GM through the Scalar unit and wants it to be written out immediately, the DataCacheCleanAndInvalid API is also required. |
| DCache | [ReadGmBypassDCache](../scalar_compute/ReadGmBypassDCache_ISASI.md)/[WriteGmBypassDCache](../scalar_compute/WriteGmBypassDCache_ISASI.md) | **Read**/**write** data to the GM address without going through DCache. Usage scenarios:<br>&bull;When data written by multiple cores falls within the same Cache Line, reads and writes through DCache are performed at a granularity of 64B, which may cause random overwriting of data across multiple cores. Using this API to directly **read**/**write** GM by operand size without going through DCache can avoid this issue.<br>&bull;Using this API to directly **read**/**write** data to GM without going through DCache can avoid the inter-core data inconsistency issue caused by DCache caching. |
| ICache | [ICachePreLoad](ICachePreLoad_ISASI.md) | The developer can manually call the ICachePreLoad API to preload instructions from the GM address where the instructions reside into ICache. |
| ICache | [GetICachePreloadStatus](GetICachePreloadStatus_ISASI.md) | GetICachePreloadStatus is a debugging API. It is called after ICachePreLoad to obtain the PreLoad status of ICache. When the return value is 0, it indicates that the ICache PreLoad is complete; when the return value is 1, it indicates that the ICache PreLoad is not complete. |
| NDDMA Cache | [NdDmaDci](../memory_vector_compute/data_move_aux_config/NdDmaDci.md) | Before using the [DataCopy (GMToUB multi-dimensional data movement NDDMA)](../../basic_api/memory_vector_compute/data_move/DataCopy_GMToUB_NDDMA.md) API for data movement, use the NdDmaDci API to flush the NDDMA Cache to ensure it is in the latest state. |
