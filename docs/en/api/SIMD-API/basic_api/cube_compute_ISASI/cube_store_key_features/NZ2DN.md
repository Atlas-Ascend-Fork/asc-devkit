## Description

During the move-out process of matrix computation, the core function of **NZ2DN** is to convert an **NZ**-format matrix into a **DN**-format matrix.

The **NZ2DN** conversion process can be referenced by the following pseudocode:

```cpp
for (int h = 0; h < dnNum; h++) {
    src_tmp3_addr = src + h * 16 * sizeof(src_element) * srcNzMatrixStride;
    dst_tmp3_addr = dst + h * sizeof(dst_element) * dstDnMatrixStride;
    for (int i = 0; i < ceil(nSize / 16); i++) {
        src_tmp2_addr = src_tmp3_addr + i * sizeof(src_element) * 16 * srcStride;
        dst_tmp2_addr = dst_tmp3_addr + i * sizeof(dst_element) * 16 * dstStride;
        for (int j = 0; j < 16; j++) {
            if (i * 16 + j < nSize) {
                src_block_addr = src_tmp2_addr + j * sizeof(src_element);
                dst_block_addr = dst_tmp2_addr + j * sizeof(dst_element) * dstStride;
                for (int k = 0; k < mSize; k++) {
                    src_ele_addr = src_block_addr + k * sizeof(src_element) * 16 * srcNzC0Stride;
                    dst_ele_addr = dst_block_addr + k * sizeof(dst_element);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The parameters used in the pseudocode are described as follows:

- **src** indicates the start address of the source operand transfer.
- **dst** indicates the start address of the destination operand transfer.
- The start address of each **NZ** matrix of the source operand is src\_tmp3\_addr.
- The start address of each **DN** matrix of the destination operand is dst\_tmp3\_addr.
- The source operand **NZ** matrix is divided into groups of 16 columns, and the start address of each group of data is src\_tmp2\_addr.
- The destination operand **DN** matrix is divided into groups of 16 rows, and the start address of each group of data is dst\_tmp2\_addr.
- In each group of data from the source NZ matrix described above, each column of elements is further treated as a group of data, and the start address of each group of data is src\_block\_addr.
- In each group of data from the destination DN matrix described above, each row of elements is further treated as a group of data, and the start address of each group of data is dst\_block\_addr.
- src\_ele\_addr is the address of each element in a column of the NZ matrix, and dst\_ele\_addr is the address of each element in a row of the DN matrix. The two are in a one-to-one correspondence, which completes the NZ2DN format conversion.

The following parameters are user-configurable parameters for NZ2DN. For their meanings and value ranges, see [Fixpipe transfer parameters (FixpipeParamsArch3510)](../cube_compute_store/Fixpipe_L0CToGM.md#parameters):

- **dnNum** indicates the number of matrices to be converted from NZ to DN.
- **mSize** and **nSize** indicate the dimensions of the matrix in the m direction and n direction, respectively.
- **srcStride** indicates the interval between the start addresses of adjacent Z layouts in the source NZ matrix, and the unit is C0\_Size.
- **dstStride** indicates the number of elements in each row of the destination DN matrix, and the unit is element.
- **srcNzMatrixStride** indicates the interval between the start addresses of different source NZ matrices, and the unit is C0\_Size.
- **dstDnMatrixStride** indicates the interval between the start addresses of adjacent destination DN matrices, and the unit is element.
- **srcNzC0Stride** indicates the address offset between adjacent rows of the source matrix NZ fractal, in C0_Size.

## Constraints

- When the Channel Split/Channel Merge function (NZ2NZ) is enabled, this function is unavailable.
- When dual-destination mode is enabled for transferring the L0C Buffer to the Unified Buffer (UB), this function is unavailable.
- The addresses of destination operands must not overlap.

## Example

As shown in the following figure, there are two NZ-format matrices in the L0C Buffer. Each matrix has a dimension of 32 in the N direction and 48 in the M direction. After NZ2DN conversion, the data format is changed to the layout shown in the right part.

For this scenario, the effect shown in the preceding figure can be achieved by configuring the parameters of the intriParams structure:

- **dnNum** = 2, indicating that the number of matrices to be converted by NZ2DN is 2.
- **nSize** = 32, indicating that the size of the source NZ matrix in the N direction is 32 elements.
- **mSize** = 48, indicating that the size of the source NZ matrix in the M direction is 48 elements.
- **srcStride** = 80, indicating that the interval between the start addresses of adjacent Z layouts in the source NZ matrix is 80 \* C0\_Size\(C0\_Size = 16\*sizeof\(T\), where T is the data type of the operand \) bytes.
- **dstStride** = 80, indicating that the number of elements in each row of the destination DN matrix is 80.
- **srcNzMatrixStride** = 240, indicates that the interval between the start addresses of different source NZ matrices is 240 \* C0\_Size.
- **dstDnMatrixStride** = 48 \* 80, indicates that the interval between the start addresses of adjacent destination DN matrices is 48 \* 80 = 3840 elements, where 48 is the number of interval rows and 80 is **dstStride** (the number of elements per row).
- **srcNzC0Stride** = 1: indicates that the address offset between adjacent rows of the source matrix NZ fractal is 1 \* C0\_Size.
