## Description

When a matrix is moved out, the **NZ2ND** function converts the matrix from the NZ format to the ND format.

The **NZ2ND** conversion process can be referenced in the following pseudocode:

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < ndNum; i++) {
    // fractal_size = 16 * sizeof(L0C_element)
    src_temp_nd_addr = src + srcNdStride * fractal_size * i;
    dst_temp_nd_addr = dst + dstNdStride * sizeof(dst_element) * i;
    for (j = 0; j < mSize; j++) {
        src_temp_n_addr = src_temp_nd_addr + j * 16 * sizeof(L0C_element);
        dst_temp_n_addr = dst_temp_nd_addr + j * dstStride * sizeof(dst_element);
        for (k = 0; k < ceil(nSize / 16); k++) {
            src_block_addr = src_temp_n_addr + k * srcStride * 16 * sizeof(L0C_element);
            dst_block_addr = dst_temp_n_addr + k * 16 * sizeof(dst_element);
        }
    }
}
```

The parameters used in the pseudocode are described as follows:

- **src** indicates the start address from which the source operand is moved.
- **dst** indicates the start address from which the destination operand is moved.
- The start address of each NZ matrix of the source operand is src\_temp\_nd\_addr.
- The start address of each ND matrix of the destination operand is dst\_temp\_nd\_addr.
- The start address of each row in each NZ matrix of the source operand is src\_temp\_n\_addr.
- The start address of each row in each ND matrix of the destination operand is dst\_temp\_n\_addr.
- In each row, 16 data elements form one data block. The start address of each data block in the source operand is src\_block\_addr, and the start address of each data block in the destination operand is dst\_block\_addr.

The following parameters are user-configurable parameters of NZ2ND. For their meanings and value ranges, see [Fixpipe transfer parameters](../cube_compute_store/Fixpipe_L0CToGM.md) and [Parameters](../cube_compute_store/Fixpipe_L0CToGM.md):

- **mSize** and **nSize** indicate the dimensions of the matrix in the m direction and n direction, respectively.
- **srcStride** indicates the interval between different Z fractal columns in the NZ matrix, in units of C0\_Size.
- **dstStride** indicates the interval between different rows in the target ND matrix, in units of elements.
- **ndNum** indicates the number of matrices that require NZ2ND conversion.
- **srcNdStride** indicates the interval between different NZ matrices, in units of 16\*C0\_Size (C0\_Size=16\*sizeof\(T\), where T is the data type of the operand) bytes.
- **dstNdStride** indicates the interval between different target ND matrices, in units of elements.

## Constraints

- When the Channel Split/Channel Merge feature (NZ2NZ) is enabled, this feature is unavailable.
- The destination operand addresses cannot overlap.

## Example

As shown in the following figure, there are two NZ-format matrices in the L0C Buffer. Each matrix has a dimension of 32 in the N direction and 48 in the M direction. After NZ2ND conversion, the data format is changed to the layout shown in the right part.

For this scenario, the effect shown in the preceding figure can be achieved by configuring the parameters of the **intriParams** structure:

- **ndNum** = 2, indicating that the number of matrices to be converted by NZ2ND is 2.
- **nSize** = 32, indicating that the size of the source NZ matrix in the N direction is 32 elements.
- **mSize** = 48, indicating that the size of the source NZ matrix in the M direction is 48 elements.
- **srcStride** = 64, indicating that the interval between the start addresses of adjacent Z layouts in the source NZ matrix is 64 \* C0\_Size\(C0\_Size = 16\*sizeof\(T\), where T is the data type of the operand \) bytes.
- **dstStride** = 64, indicating that the number of elements in each row of the destination ND matrix is 64.
- **srcNdStride** = 256, indicates different NZ matrices' start addresses are spaced 256 \* C0\_Size bytes apart.
- **dstNdStride** = 4096, indicating that the offset between the start addresses of adjacent destination ND matrices is 4096 elements.
