## Binary Precision Rounding Rules

Before learning the conversion rules between different types, you need to first understand the binary precision rounding rules.

As shown in the following figure, the trailing bits of a binary number may be discarded because the target precision is insufficient. This part is called the **part to be rounded**, and the remaining retained part is called the **non-rounded part**. Based on the value of the part to be rounded and the selected **precision rounding mode**, it is determined whether the last bit of the non-rounded part needs **+1 (carry)**.

**Figure 1** Schematic diagram of binary precision rounding rules<a name="fig1"></a>

![Schematic diagram of binary precision rounding rules](../../../figures/binary_rounding.png)

The judgment rules of each precision rounding mode for the part to be rounded are shown in the following table:

**Table 1** Precision rounding modes<a id="tab1"></a>

| Mode | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| CAST_NONE | When there is precision loss during conversion, it is processed according to the CAST_RINT mode; when there is no precision loss, no rounding is performed. |
| CAST_RINT | Round to the nearest even number.<br>&bull;If the first bit of the part to be rounded is 0, then no carry is performed.<br>&bull;If the first bit of the part to be rounded is 1 and the subsequent bits are not all 0, then carry is performed.<br>&bull;If the first bit of the part to be rounded is 1 and the subsequent bits are all 0: when the last bit of the non-rounded part is 0, then no carry is performed; when the last bit of the non-rounded part is 1, then carry is performed. |
| CAST_FLOOR | Round toward negative infinity.<br>&bull;If the sign bit (S) is 0 (positive number), then no carry is performed.<br>&bull;If the sign bit (S) is 1 (negative number): when the part to be rounded is all 0, then no carry is performed; otherwise, carry is performed. |
| CAST_CEIL | Round toward positive infinity.<br>&bull;If the sign bit (S) is 1 (negative number), then no carry is performed.<br>&bull;If the sign bit (S) is 0 (positive number): when the part to be rounded is all 0, then no carry is performed; otherwise, carry is performed. |
| CAST_ROUND | Round half up. If the first bit of the part to be rounded is 0, then no carry is performed; otherwise, carry is performed. |
| CAST_TRUNC | Truncation mode. Directly discard the part to be rounded. |
| CAST_ODD | Round to the nearest odd number.<br>&bull;If the part to be rounded is all 0, then no carry is performed.<br>&bull;If the part to be rounded is not all 0: when the last bit of the non-rounded part is 1, then no carry is performed; when the last bit of the non-rounded part is 0, then carry is performed. |
| CAST_HYBRID | Random rounding, which currently specifically refers to a random rounding used when the output result is of the hifloat8_t data type. |

## Precision Conversion Rules

This section mainly introduces the rounding behavior during precision conversion between different data types. For the representation of different data types, see [Built-in Data Types](builtin_data_types.md). When the source value exceeds the representable range of the target type, overflow occurs, and overflow is handled in saturation mode by default.

**Figure 4** float to half

![float to half](../../../figures/float_to_half.png)

The exponent bits of half can represent $2^{-1}$, $E_v = -1 + 15 = 14$, but half has only 10 mantissa bits, therefore the gray part needs to be rounded:

**Example**: Input: $0.5 + 2^{-9} + 2^{-11}$, written as the float representation form: $2^{-1} \times (1 + 2^{-8} + 2^{-10})$, therefore $E_v = -1 + 127 = 126$, $M_v = 2^{-8} + 2^{-10}$.

**Figure 5** float to bfloat16_t

![float to bfloat16_t](../../../figures/float_to_bfloat16_t.png)

The number of exponent bits of bfloat16_t is the same as that of float, with $E_v = 126$, but bfloat16_t has only a 7-bit mantissa, therefore the gray part needs to perform rounding:

- **CAST_RINT mode**: rounding yields the mantissa `0000001`, $E_v = 126$, $M_v = 2^{-7}$, and the final result is $0.5 + 2^{-8}$.

**Figure 6** int64_t to float

![int64_t to float](../../../figures/int64_t_to_float.png)

Because float has only a 23-bit mantissa, the gray part needs to be rounded:

Convert the source value according to the precision rounding mode to a number that can be represented by double, and store it in the destination operand in double format.

**Example**: Input: $2^{61} + 2^9 + 2^8$, written as the double representation form: $2^{61} \times (1 + 2^{-52} + 2^{-53})$, requiring $E_v = 61 + 1023 = 1084$, $M_v = 2^{-52} + 2^{-53}$.

Because double has only 52 bits of mantissa, the gray part needs to be rounded:

- **CAST_RINT mode**: Rounding yields the mantissa `...010`, $E_v = 1084$, $M_v = 2^{-51}$, and the final representation result is $2^{61} + 2^{10}$.
- **CAST_FLOOR mode**: Rounding yields the mantissa `...001`, $E_v = 1084$, $M_v = 2^{-52}$, and the final representation result is $2^{61} + 2^9$.
- **CAST_CEIL mode**: Rounding yields the mantissa `...010`, $E_v = 1084$, $M_v = 2^{-51}$, and the final representation result is $2^{61} + 2^{10}$.
- **CAST_ROUND mode**: Rounding yields the mantissa `...010`, $E_v = 1084$, $M_v = 2^{-51}$, and the final representation result is $2^{61} + 2^{10}$.
- **CAST_TRUNC mode** rounding yields the mantissa `...001`, $E_v = 1084$, $M_v = 2^{-52}$, and the final representation result is $2^{61} + 2^9$.



### double → float

Convert the source value according to the precision rounding mode to a number that can be represented by float, and store it in the destination operand in float format.

**Example**: Input: $2^{35} + 2^{12} + 2^{11}$, written in float representation: $2^{35} \times (1 + 2^{-23} + 2^{-24})$, requiring $E_v = 1058 - 1023 + 127 = 162$, $M_v = 2^{-23} + 2^{-24}$.

**Figure 8** Schematic diagram of double to float conversion

![Schematic diagram of double to float conversion](../../../figures/float.png)

Because float has only an 8-bit exponent, the exponent part needs to be converted, and only a 23-bit mantissa, the gray part needs to be rounded:

- In **CAST_RINT** mode, rounding yields the mantissa 00000000000000000000010, $E_v = 162$, $M_v = 2^{-22}$, and the final representation result is $2^{35} + 2^{13}$.
- In **CAST_FLOOR** mode, rounding yields the mantissa 00000000000000000000001, $E_v = 162$, $M_v = 2^{-23}$, and the final representation result is $2^{35} + 2^{12}$.
- In **CAST_CEIL** mode, rounding yields the mantissa 00000000000000000000010, $E_v = 162$, $M_v = 2^{-22}$, and the final representation result is $2^{35} + 2^{13}$.
- In **CAST_ROUND** mode, rounding yields the mantissa 00000000000000000000010, $E_v = 162$, $M_v = 2^{-22}$, and the final representation result is $2^{35} + 2^{13}$.
- **CAST_TRUNC mode** rounding yields the mantissa 00000000000000000000001, $E_v = 162$, $M_v = 2^{-23}$, and the final representation result is $2^{35} + 2^{12}$.



### double → bfloat16_t

Convert the source value according to the precision rounding mode to a number that can be represented by bfloat16_t, and store it in the destination operand in bfloat16_t format.

**Example**: Input: $2^{35} + 2^{28} + 2^{27}$, written as the bfloat16_t representation form: $2^{35} \times (1 + 2^{-7} + 2^{-8})$, requiring $E_v = 1058 - 1023 + 127 = 162$, $M_v = 2^{-7} + 2^{-8}$.

**Figure 9** Schematic diagram of double to bfloat16_t conversion

![Schematic diagram of double to bfloat16_t conversion](../../../figures/double2bfloat16.png)

Because bfloat16_t has only an 8-bit exponent, the exponent part needs to be converted, and it has only a 7-bit mantissa, therefore the gray part needs to be rounded:

- **CAST_RINT mode**: rounding yields the mantissa 0000010, $E_v = 162$, $M_v = 2^{-6}$, and the final representation result is $2^{35} + 2^{29}$.
- **CAST_FLOOR mode**: rounding yields the mantissa 0000001, $E_v = 162$, $M_v = 2^{-7}$, and the final representation result is $2^{35} + 2^{28}$.
- **CAST_CEIL mode**: rounding yields the mantissa 0000010, $E_v = 162$, $M_v = 2^{-6}$, and the final representation result is $2^{35} + 2^{29}$.
- **CAST_ROUND mode**: rounding yields the mantissa 0000010, $E_v = 162$, $M_v = 2^{-6}$, and the final representation result is $2^{35} + 2^{29}$.
- **CAST_TRUNC mode** rounding yields the mantissa 0000001, $E_v = 162$, $M_v = 2^{-7}$, and the final representation result is $2^{35} + 2^{28}$.
