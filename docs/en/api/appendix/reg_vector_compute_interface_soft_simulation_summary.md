This section summarizes the soft simulation data types of Reg vector compute APIs. The content in this section applies only to the following models:

Ascend 950PR & 950DT products

The [Reg Data Load](../SIMD-API/basic_api/reg_vector_compute/reg_data_load/reg_data_load.md) and [Reg Data Store](../SIMD-API/basic_api/reg_vector_compute/reg_data_store/reg_data_store.md) directories provide data movement APIs between Unified Buffer (UB) and RegTensor, and between UB and MaskReg.

Data movement between UB and RegTensor is performed based on the bit width of the operand data type, independent of the data type itself. The soft simulation supported data types listed in Table 1 and Table 2 include the following cases:

- The underlying hardware does not support the data type, and it is implemented through move instructions supported by other data types with the same bit width.
- The underlying hardware does not support the data type, and it is implemented through soft simulation by combining multiple APIs.
- The underlying hardware does not support the data type, and the RegTraitNumTwo data type is implemented through soft simulation in dual move-in/dual move-out mode.
