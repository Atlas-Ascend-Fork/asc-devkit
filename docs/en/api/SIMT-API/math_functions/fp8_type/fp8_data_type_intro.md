SIMT programming supports three fp8 data types: float8\_e4m3\_t, float8\_e5m2\_t, and hifloat8\_t. Their value ranges are as follows:

| Type | Sign Bit Width | Exponent Bit Width | Mantissa Bit Width | Value Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| float8_e4m3_t | 1 | 4 | 3 | [$2^{6} - 2^{9}$, $2^{9} - 2^{6}$] |
| float8_e5m2_t | 1 | 5 | 2 | [$2^{13} - 2^{16}$, $2^{16} - 2^{13}$] |
| hifloat8_t | 1 | Determined by point field encoding | Determined by point field encoding | Point field encoding determines data precision and value range |

A floating-point number consists of three parts: the sign bit (S), the exponent (E), and the mantissa (M). For different floating-point types, the number of bits occupied by these three parts may differ.

    The following figure shows an example of the fp8\_e4m3fn\_t type, in which the sign bit occupies 1 bit, the exponent occupies 4 bits, and the mantissa occupies 3 bits. The represented result is \(-1\)^1 × 2^-3 × 2^-6.

-   float8\_e5m2\_t

    The following figure shows an example of the fp8\_e5m2\_t type, in which the sign bit occupies 1 bit, the exponent occupies 5 bits, and the mantissa occupies 2 bits. The represented result is \(-1\)^0 × \(2 - 0.25\) × 2^\(30 -15\)=1.75 × 2^15.

-   hifloat8\_t

    Compared with other types, the **hifloat8_t** type adds an exponent bit width control field **D**, which is used to indicate the encoding scheme of the exponent bits and mantissa bits.

    The **hifloat8_t** type has different encoding schemes depending on the point domain, which are listed below.

    In the following example, the sign bit occupies 1 bit, the exponent occupies 2 bits, and the mantissa occupies 3 bits. The **D** field is 2 bits, b01, with S<sub>v</sub>=1, E<sub>v</sub>=3, and M<sub>v</sub> = 2<sup>-1</sup> + 2<sup>-2</sup>, representing the result 14. The subscript v indicates the specific value of each part.
