## Description

The header file paths are: `"simt_api/device_functions.h"` (for APIs other than the half, half2, bfloat16_t, and bfloat16x2_t types), `"simt_api/asc_fp16.h"` (for the half and half2 type APIs), and `"simt_api/asc_bf16.h"` (for the bfloat16_t and bfloat16x2_t type APIs).

It first loads cached data from the Data Cache. On a cache miss, it attempts to load from the L2 Cache. Data consistency between the L2 Cache and Global Memory is guaranteed by hardware, but data consistency between the Data Cache and Global Memory is not guaranteed. If the required data is not found in either the Data Cache or the L2 Cache, the data is read from Global Memory and then cached into both the L2 Cache and the Data Cache.  
The underlying implementation of the default memory access is the same as this interface. For example:
```cpp
dst[idx] = src[idx];
``` 
Its underlying implementation is equivalent to 
```cpp
dst[idx] = asc_ldca(src + idx);
```

## Parameters

**Table 1**  Parameters

| Parameter | Input/Output | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| address | Input | Address in Global Memory. |

## Return Value

Returns the data in Global Memory pointed to by the input. The execution flow for reading data is as follows:

- If the Data Cache is hit, the data corresponding to the address is returned directly from the Data Cache.
- If the Data Cache misses but the L2 Cache hits, the data corresponding to the address is returned from the L2 Cache.
- If both the Data Cache and the L2 Cache miss, the data corresponding to the address is read from Global Memory and returned.

## Constraints

None

## Examples

-   SIMT programming scenario:

    ```cpp
    #include "simt_api/device_functions.h"

    __global__ __launch_bounds__(1024) void kernel_asc_ldca(float* dst, float* src)
    {
        int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
        dst[idx] = asc_ldca(src + idx);
    }
    ```

-   SIMD and SIMT hybrid programming scenario:

    In the SIMD and SIMT hybrid programming scenario, address space qualifiers must be explicitly used to indicate the address space: `__gm__` indicates the Global Memory space.

    ```cpp
    #include "simt_api/device_functions.h"

    __simt_vf__ __launch_bounds__(1024) inline void kernel_asc_ldca(__gm__ float* dst, __gm__ float* src)
    {
        int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
        dst[idx] = asc_ldca(src + idx);
    }
    ```
