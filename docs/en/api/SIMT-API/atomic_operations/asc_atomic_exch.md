## Description

The header file paths are: `"simt_api/device_atomic_functions.h"` (for interfaces other than the half2 and bfloat16x2\_t types), `"simt_api/asc_fp16.h"` (for the half2 type interfaces), and `"simt_api/asc_bf16.h"` (for the bfloat16x2\_t type interfaces).

Performs an atomic assignment operation on a Unified Buffer (UB) or Global Memory address, that is, assigns the specified data to the UB or Global Memory address.

## Prototype

```cpp
inline float asc_atomic_exch(float *address, float val)
```

```cpp
inline int32_t asc_atomic_exch(int32_t *address, int32_t val)
```

```cpp
inline uint32_t asc_atomic_exch(uint32_t *address, uint32_t val)
```

```cpp
inline int64_t asc_atomic_exch(int64_t *address, int64_t val)
```

```cpp
inline uint64_t asc_atomic_exch(uint64_t *address, uint64_t val)
```

```cpp
inline half2 asc_atomic_exch(half2 *address, half2 val)
```

```cpp
inline bfloat16x2_t asc_atomic_exch(bfloat16x2_t *address, bfloat16x2_t val)
```

## Parameters

**Table 1**  Parameters

| Name | Input/Output | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| address | Output | Address in UB or Global Memory. |
| val | Input | Source operand. |

The memory ranges supported by different data types are described as follows:

**Table 2**  Memory ranges supported by different data types

| Parameter Data Type | Supported Memory Space |
| --- | --- |
| int32_t, uint32_t, float, half2, bfloat16x2_t | UB, Global Memory |
| int64_t, uint64_t | Global Memory |

## Return Value

Initial data in UB or Global Memory.

## Constraints

-   Atomic operations guarantee the atomicity of the read-modify-write process on the same address, but do not guarantee the execution order among multiple threads. When multiple threads write different values to the same address, the value ultimately retained depends on the serialization order of the atomic operations, which may vary with thread scheduling.
-   The performance of this API is affected by the following factors. For the related principles, see [Atomic Operation Mechanism](atomic_operations_intro.md#atomic-operation-mechanism).
    -   Memory space: The access path of UB is shorter than that of Global Memory, and usually has lower access overhead. When the data type used supports UB (that is, int32\_t, uint32\_t, float, half2, bfloat16x2\_t), it is recommended to complete the atomic operation in UB first.
    -   Return value: This API has no corresponding performance optimization instruction. For all data types, whether the return value of this API is used in the program has little impact on the API performance.
    -   Address distribution: Global Memory atomic operations are processed through L2 Cache. L2 Cache uses a 512B Cache Line as the cache management unit, and each Cache Line contains four 128B sectors. Global Memory atomic operations use a 128B Sector as the processing granularity. When destination addresses are concentrated in the same Sector, the processing efficiency is lower; when destination addresses are distributed across more Sectors, the processing efficiency is higher. Therefore, when the business allows, it is recommended to distribute the destination addresses of atomic operations across more Sectors.

## Examples

The example scenario is as follows: multiple threads scan fault flags. A thread that detects a fault uses the `asc_atomic_exch` interface to set the shared status to the fault status and records the old status before the exchange. The input parameters are described as follows:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `fault_flags` | Each element represents a detection result, where 0 indicates no fault and a non-zero value indicates a fault. |
| `status` | Shared status in Global Memory, where 0 indicates normal and 1 indicates fault. |
| `old_status` | Stores the old status read by each faulting thread before the exchange. |
| `n` | Number of input elements. |

The core code implementation is as follows:

-   SIMT programming scenario:

    ```cpp
    #include "simt_api/device_atomic_functions.h"

    __global__ __launch_bounds__(256) void publish_fault_status(uint32_t *status,
                                                               uint32_t *old_status,
                                                               uint32_t *fault_flags,
                                                               uint32_t n)
    {
        uint32_t idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
        if (idx >= n) {
            return;
        }

        if (fault_flags[idx] != 0U) {
            old_status[idx] = asc_atomic_exch(status, 1U);
        }
    }
    ```

-   SIMD and SIMT hybrid programming scenario:

    In mixed SIMD and SIMT programming scenarios, address space qualifiers must be used explicitly to indicate the address space: `__gm__` indicates the Global Memory memory space, and `__ubuf__` indicates the UB memory space.

    ```cpp
    #include "simt_api/device_atomic_functions.h"

    __simt_vf__ __launch_bounds__(1024) inline void publish_fault_status(__gm__ uint32_t *status,
                                                                        __gm__ uint32_t *old_status,
                                                                        __gm__ uint32_t *fault_flags,
                                                                        uint32_t n)
    {
        uint32_t idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
        if (idx >= n) {
            return;
        }

        if (fault_flags[idx] != 0U) {
            old_status[idx] = asc_atomic_exch(status, 1U);
        }
    }
    ```

An example of the output result is as follows:

```
fault_flags: 0, 1, 0, 1
status before: 0
status after: 1 // Indicates that at least one thread detected a fault and published the fault status.
```
